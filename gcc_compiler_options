lets learn about g++ compiler options by exploring codeforces g++ run command :
 GNU C++11 4
 g++.exe  -static 
          -fno-optimize-sibling-calls 
          -fno-strict-aliasing 
          -DONLINE_JUDGE 
          -lm 
          -s 
          -x c++ 
          -Wl,--stack=268435456 
          -O2 
          -std=c++11 
          -D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=0 
          -o {filename}.exe {file}

-foptimize-sibling-calls
 Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.
 Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.

  In practice, GCC synonym for "tail" (they refer to it as a.k.a. tail in the internals documentation). 
  Formally, some function which has a return type of the same size and a parameter list of the same total word size. 
  Thus, e.g. int foo(char, char) and int bar(short) would be siblings and could be tail-optimized 
  (so foo calling bar which calls foo would in principle work)

 О языках программирования и технических аспектах

so lets go deeper (e.g. 'man gcc' or 'man g++' or 'man ld' which stand for compiler or linker):

-static
 On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared libraries. 
 On other systems, this option has no effect.
 
-x language
 Specify explicitly the language for the following input files 
 (rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file name suffix). 
 This option applies to all following input files until the next `-x' option. Possible values for language are:
  
 c  c-header  cpp-output
 c++  c++-cpp-output
 objective-c  objc-cpp-output
 assembler  assembler-with-cpp
 f77  f77-cpp-input  ratfor
 java
 
-s
 Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
 
-Wl\,option
 Pass option as an option to the linker. If option contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

--stack reserve
--stack reserve,commit
  Specify the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and optionally commit) to be used as stack for this program.  
  The default is 2Mb reserved, 4K committed.
  [This option is specific to the i386 PE(portable executable) targeted port of the linker]
 
-llibrary
 Search the library named library when linking.
 It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; 
 the linker searches processes libraries and object files in the order they are specified. 
 Thus, `foo.o -lz bar.o' searches library `z' after file `foo.o' but before `bar.o'. 
 If `bar.o' refers to functions in `z', those functions may not be loaded.

 The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library, which is actually a file named `liblibrary.a'. 
 The linker then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

 The directories searched include several standard system directories plus any that you specify with `-L'.

 Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files whose members are object files. 
 The linker handles an archive file by scanning through it for members which define symbols 
 that have so far been referenced but not defined. 
 But if the file that is found is an ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion. 
 The only difference between using an `-l' option and specifying a file name is that `-l' surrounds library 
 with `lib' and `.a' and searches several directories.
 
-lm is for m.lib
 The MLib (pronounced "M-Lib") is a C software framework that significantly simplifies the development of 
 highly reliable system-level libraries and programs (like daemons/services). 
 It is small, efficient, robust and highly portable, and was designed primarily for embedded systems.
 
-O2
 Optimize even more. 
 GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. 
 The compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify `-O2'. 
 As compared to `-O', this option increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.
 `-O2' turns on all optional optimizations except for loop unrolling, function inlining, and register renaming. 
 It also turns on the `-fforce-mem' option on all machines and frame pointer elimination on machines where doing so 
 does not interfere with debugging.
 
-o file
 Place output in file file. This applies regardless to whatever sort of output is being produced, 
 whether it be an executable file, an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
 Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make sense to use `-o' when compiling more than one input file, 
 unless you are producing an executable file as output.

 If `-o' is not specified, the default is to put an executable file in `a.out', 
 the object file for `source.suffix' in `source.o', its assembler file in `source.s', 
 and all preprocessed C source on standard output.
